======================================*/

1. There are two threads. The main thread that runs int main() and the one created by pthread.

2.  16 creating instance of pthread
    17 creating instance of pthread attribute
    20 initializes the thread attributes object pointed to by attr with default attribute values.
    25 Create a new thread
    26 Waits for the thread specified by thread to terminate.

3. One parameter.

4. Because they are global variables.

5. Since the join waits for the pthread to finish if the line 26 is omitted the function will not wait for the random generator and the array will not be sorted and the system will not work properly.
